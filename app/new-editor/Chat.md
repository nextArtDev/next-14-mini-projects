The TypeScript error you’re encountering suggests there is a type mismatch in your application. The error occurs because `values.description` is expected to be a string based on the zod schema you are likely using (`z.infer<typeof formSchema>`), but you are trying to treat it as a TipTap editor instance.

### Understanding the Error

1. **Schema Type:** Your form schema (defined using Zod) likely specifies that `description` is a string. This is typical if you're using a form library that reads from schema to determine field values.
2. **Method Mismatch:** The `getHTML()` method is a method on TipTap's editor instance, not on a string type. Hence, TypeScript throws an error because it doesn't recognize `getHTML()` as a valid method for a string.

### How to Fix It

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the `description` field is managed appropriately as an editor instance and not just as a text/string input. Here’s a step-by-step approach to adjusting your handling of the TipTap editor alongside form controls possibly using a tool like `react-hook-form` or similar.

**Step 1: Manage Editor State Separately**

If you haven't initialized your TipTap editor in the component, do it like so:

```typescript
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react';
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit';

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [StarterKit],
  content: '<p>Hello World!</p>'
});
```

**Step 2: Sync Editor Content with Form**

You need to synchronize the editor's content with the form state. If you’re using a form library, you might need to do this manually:

```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react';

// Assuming you're using something like react-hook-form
const { setValue, watch } = useForm();

const editorContent = watch('description');

// Sync form state with the editor's content
useEffect(() => {
    if (editor) {
        editor.commands.setContent(editorContent || '');
    }
}, [editor, editorContent]);

// When submitting the form
const onSubmit = () => {
    if (!editor) {
        return;
    }

    const htmlContent = editor.getHTML();
    // Do something with htmlContent, like sending it to server
};
```

**Step 3: Update Form on Editor Change**

Make sure to update your form state when the editor's content changes:

```typescript
// Listen to editor updates
useEffect(() => {
  if (!editor) {
    return;
  }

  const update = () => {
    setValue('description', editor.getHTML(), { shouldValidate: true });
  };

  editor.on('update', update);

  return () => {
    editor.off('update', update);
  };
}, [editor, setValue]);
```

**Step 4: Adjust the HTML Form Input**

Ensure your form inputs related to the TipTap editor are set up to work seamlessly with the managed state:

```jsx
<EditorContent editor={editor} />
```

### Conclusion

The core adjustment here is ensuring that the form state and the editor state are properly managed and synchronized, which involves setting up event listeners and effect hooks to handle the synchronization between your TypeScript type expectations and the dynamic content manipulation that occurs within TipTap.
